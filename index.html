                <cite title="Matt Hodges">By: Matt Hodges, 2020-06-07</cite>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>I don’t consider myself an especially gifted writer, so I’ll keep this brief.</p>

                <p>On June 4th, Jason Bracken published an account and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jasontbracken/videos/10158464112687238" target="_blank">supporting video</a> of Miami University faculty member Douglas Brooks following a Black Lives Matter rally in Oxford Ohio, approaching protesters, and referring to the group as “a bunch of monkeys.” Bracken, who is a member of the Oxford City Council and a Ph.D. candidate at Miami University, affirms that Brooks yelled racist slurs at the group, and then shows the man asserting his “confidence” after being told he’s being filmed. Since posting, many current and former students have come forward with reports of racism and sexism by Brooks.</p>

                <p>In the following days, Miami University leadership issued two statements. <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/news/top-stories/2020/06/provost-message.html" target="_blank">A statement from University Provost Jason Osborne</a> states that he is “troubled” by what Brooks did, finds it “inconceivable” that these things still happen in 2020, and then proceeds to suggest that any swift disciplinary action would “violate the Constitution of the United States.” He says students can choose to complete their coursework with another professor. In a separate statement, <a href="https://miamioh.edu/about-miami/leadership/president/messages/reports-of-racist-speech-june-05-2020/index.html" target="_blank">University President Gregory Crawford expresses</a> that he too is “deeply disturbed” by the reports, and that students may switch to a different professor.</p>
                
                <p>Both statements make odes to Miami’s “commitment” to diversity and inclusion, but anyone who has spent any time on campus won’t hesitate to note the racial, political, and social-economic homogeneity of the student body.</p>

                <p>Suffice it to say that these responses are beyond inadequate. Employees, in both the public and private sectors, are bound by a set of behavioural expectations. People are frequently terminated after being exposed for their hateful actions both inside and outside the workplace. That Miami University is hiding behind “free speech” as a reason for keeping Douglas Brooks on faculty is absurd. No one is suggesting he should be arrested or fined for his hateful speech, the demands are that he be fired. The Constitution protects a person from government prosecution, it does not guarantee employment. It is clear that Douglas Brooks should not be an arbiter of higher education.</p>
                    
                <p>Miami’s official slogan is “Love and Honor” but these actions by a faculty member, and inactions by university leadership, are nothing short of Hate and Cowardice.</p>

                <p>I am an occasional donor to Miami University, but I won’t be donating again any time soon. Additionally, I was informed on April 30th that I am a nominee for this year’s recognition, <a href="https://www.miamialum.org/s/916/16/interior.aspx?sid=916&gid=1&pgid=17300&cid=33190&ecid=33190&crid=0&calpgid=269&calcid=1238&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=eighteen_of_nine&utm_content=nominees_announcement" target="_blank">18 Of The Last 9</a>. Consider this my formal withdrawal from consideration. We are in an important moment as a country, and my name and voice are not in need of elevation. I implore the alumni association to amplify a truly diverse group of recent graduates who are working to create a more just world.</p>

                <p>The words in this piece are mine, and mine alone. I speak only for myself, but I suspect there are many who share these thoughts.</p>
